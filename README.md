# iscroll-click-directive [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/javiercejudo/iscroll-click-directive.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/javiercejudo/iscroll-click-directive)

Custom click AngularJS directive for iScroll. It helps work around accidental clicks while dragging on desktop in the context of an Angular app.

## When to use it

Before using this, you should check if `options.click` and/or `options.preventDefault` set to `true` fixes unintendid clicks ([official docs](http://iscrolljs.com/)). If for some reason that isn't possible for your case, then that's when you use this.

## Install

    bower install --save-dev iscroll-click-directive

## Usage

Please see the [provided example](test/fixtures/index.html) or [visit the demo](https://iscroll-click-directive.herokuapp.com/).
